<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p><strong>This assignment is for graduate students (CMPUT 501) only. CMPUT 402 students do not complete this assignment.</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to read, understand, and present recent research related to the QA topics we've covered in class.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose a recent full length conference paper or journal article about any of the topics we've covered in class.<ul>
<li>Must be from the last two years.</li>
<li>Must focus on one of the QA topics we've covered in class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send your choice of paper to the instructor <strong>by March 15th.</strong><ul>
<li>The instructor will approve or deny it based on its relevance to the course content, and the above requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read and understand the paper.<ul>
<li>If you've never done this kind of thing before, you may also need to take a look at least at the abstracts of the important works it cites, so that you have a full understanding of the context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Present the paper to the class:<ul>
<li>a. Your presentation must be targeted to the audience, which is the undergrads who are in the class.</li>
<li>b. Presentation should be at between 25-30 minutes, no more, no less.</li>
<li>c. Presentation should cover all the aspects of the paper: background, research questions/hypothesis, experimental design, results, conclusions the authors drew about it.</li>
<li>d. If you use diagrams or statements from the paper or other papers they must be cited.</li>
<li>e. You can use PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever presentation software you like.</li>
<li>f. You will need to present in class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must be able to answer questions about the paper for 5-10 minutes afterwards:<ul>
<li>a. Even if the undergrads decide to skip class or not ask any questions, rest assured that I will be asking you questions.</li>
<li>b. You are expected to attend each other's presentations and ask questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="marking">Marking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Timely proposal of research paper meeting the criteria is worth 1 mark.</li>
<li>Presentation is marked by the below rubric (out of 5):</li>
